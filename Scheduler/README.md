[IOS: Inter-operator Scheduler for CNN Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01302.pdf)

- [Code](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/inter-operator-scheduler)

- By automatically schedule multiple operatorsâ€™ parallel execution through a novel dynamic programming algorithm,Inter-Operator Scheduler (IOS) outperforms SOTA algorithms on accelerating CNN inference.

[Geryon: Accelerating Distributed CNN Training by Network-Level Flow Scheduling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9155282)

- By leveraging multiple flows with different priorities to transfer parameters of different urgency levels, Geryon, a network-level flow scheduling scheme, can accelerate distributed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training without modification in CNN models and training accuracy loss.
