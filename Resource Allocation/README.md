# Resource allocation 

[A Flexible Distributed Optimization Framework for Service of Concurrent Tasks in Processing Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8737632)

- By using a probabilistic computing resource allocation strategy while guaranteeing the satisfactory performance of distributed optimization, this paper's design can achieve the lower computation and communication costs and possess the flexibility to share the computing resources with other ongoing tasks.
