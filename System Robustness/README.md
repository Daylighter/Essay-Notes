# System Robustness

[Efficient and Robust LiDAR-Based End-to-End Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09932.pdf)

- By using sparse convolution kernel optimization, hardware-aware model design, and Hybrid Evidential Fusion that estimates the uncertainty of the prediction, Fast-LiDARNet improves robustness and reduces the number of takeovers in the real world.
