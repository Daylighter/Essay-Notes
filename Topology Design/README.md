# Topology Design

[Systematic Topology Design for Large-Scale Networks: A Unified Framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9155462)

- By reverse-engineering existing topology designs and developing a fine-grained decomposition method, this paper's design of a general procedure that serves as a common language to describe topology design can describe, generate, and analyze topology design in a systematic fashion, while being able to generate topology models.

[Distributed Self-Adjusting Tree Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8737417)

- By using algorithms that perform decentralized and concurrent topological adjustments to account for changes in the demand, DiSptayNet is a fully ditributed, provably efficient self-adjusting network that can design dynamic network topologies.

[Impact of Network Topology on the Performance of DML: Theoretical Analysis and Practical Factors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8737595)

- By study the impact of network topology on the DML performance between Fat-Tree and BCube, this paper suggest to use BCube instead of Fat-Tree for DML because of BCube's parallel synchronization, RDMA friendliness, natural load balance, as well as low economical cost.

[The Role of Network Topology for Distributed Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8737602)

- By using a model to quantity how the time to solve the minimization problem depends on the network of information exchanges among the nodes, this paper study how the variability of task execution times at cluster nodes affects the system throughput and that the clique is not necessarily the most effective topology.
